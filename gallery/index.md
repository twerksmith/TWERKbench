 A smattering of TWERKstation photos, specifically kit serial #002

# Version 1: Gotta Start Somewhere

Selected an affordable plastic carrying box, pulled out the foam and cut a pegboard to the proper size. Used the open-cell foam I had pulled out as a cushion for the radio and batteries before gently snugging them down with zip-ties.

The main panel has a smaller panel than can be flipped over to keep the remote radio face from cracking the LCD screen secured in the lid.
